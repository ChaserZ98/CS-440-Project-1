# CS-440-Project-1 Fast Trajectory Replanning
## Part 1
(a) There are three available actions at E2, to the west, to the north and to the east. The destinations of three actions are respectively E1, D2 and E3.
<br>`f(E1)=g(E1)+h(E1)=1+4=5`
<br>`f(D2)=g(D2)+h(D2)=1+4=5`
<br>`f(E3)=g(E3)+h(E3)=1+2=3`
<br>Since E3 has the least f value, then the first move is to the E3, which is to the east.
